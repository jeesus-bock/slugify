# slugify
I couldn't find a package to slugify the way I wanted so I wrote this function. It's tuned for finnish language,
but can be tweaked easily for other similiar languages.

## Usage
There's no npm package or anything, just copy the code to utils file or say `slugify.ts` and `import { slugify } from './slugify.ts';`
